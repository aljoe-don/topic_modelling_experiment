Not so! My computer was supplied with my name in an 'interesting'
mix of upper and lower case, and my workplace mis-typed. I'm
getting fed up with being 'CMyearslEY' at 'KEEL UNVERSITY'!
It took me 20 (!) phone calls to the supplier to get the computer
working at all. I really can't face tackling them again....
