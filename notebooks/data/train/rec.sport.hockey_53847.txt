Root for another team. ;-)
..
Andreychuk, is NOT small, slow and sloth-like, maybe, but he is
about 6'4" and that is not what I would consider as small.
As an aside, The big AndreyCHUNK as I call him has been known to
disappear come playoff time.  This was one of his main problems when
playing for Buffalo.
GO SABRES !!!
