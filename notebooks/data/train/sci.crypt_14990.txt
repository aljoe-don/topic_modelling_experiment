This assumes the person is using the hardware debug instruction of an X86
type processor.  It can be negated by NOP'ing the clear debug instruction,
or by running the code on a machine simulator, like one I wrote as a senior
project in college.  It can bypass and trace practically anything one could
write in software.  Kind of like being on a Star Trek Holideck :-).
