Well they don't export anywhere near 50% of their GNP. Mexico's perhaps
but not their own. They actually export around the 9-10% mark. Similar
to most developed countries actually. Australia exports a larger share
of GNP as does the United States (14% I think off hand. Always likely to
be out by a factor of 12 or more though) This would be immediately obvious
if you thought about it.
It is their import routes that count. They can do without exports but
they couldn't live without imports for any longer than six months if that.
Too true! But one that is unstable and hence a source of serious worry.
