	Been a while since you hit the PIP? The pavement (at least until around
	exit 9) is for sh*t these days. I think it must have taken a beating
	this winter, because I don't remember it being this bad. It's all
	breaking apart, and there are some serious potholes now. Of course
	there are also the storm drains that are *in* your lane as opposed
	to on the side of the road (talk about annoying cost saving measures).
		
	As for traffic, don't try it around 5:15 - 6:30 on weekdays (outbound,
	rush hour happens inbound too) as there are many BDC's...
