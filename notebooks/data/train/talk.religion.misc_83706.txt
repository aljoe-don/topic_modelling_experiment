Where were you brought up?  In the former USSR?  Is Innocent until proven  
guilty by a jury of your peers, NOT Dan Rather, dead in this country?  Seems  
so.  Is tax evasion, the only charge brought against the BDs, punishable by  
death in this country, now?
Not really.  You are a blind idiot.
"Not sure", yet you condem them to death for it?  If the BATF had stayed home,  
all would be alive, now.  So who murdered who?
You have a short memory.
next.
Sleep well, tonite, heartless idiot.  Sleep the sleep of the simple-minded.
I shall weep for my country, myself.
I'm short of patience tonite, but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment  
than the BDs got.
Jim
