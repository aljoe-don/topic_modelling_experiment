I'd like to point out that I was in error - "Terminator" began posting only 
six months before he purchased his first firearm, according to private email
from him.
I can't produce an archived posting of his earlier than January 1992,
and he purchased his first firearm in March 1992.
I guess it only seemed like years.
Back to your regularly scheduled flame fest.
