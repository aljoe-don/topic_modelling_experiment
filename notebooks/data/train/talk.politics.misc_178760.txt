Marriage isn't a requirement for a couple staying together.
Yes you are.  When you and the rest of the homosexual community
pass laws to impose your moral codes on me, by requiring me to
hire, rent to, or otherwise associate with a homosexual against
my will, yes, you are in my face.  Until homosexuals stop trying
to impose their morals on me, I will be in your face about this.
