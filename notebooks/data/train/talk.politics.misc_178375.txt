What suburban kid would want to hold down a minimum wage job when there is so
much more money to be made dealing drugs?
Yet, somehow, surburban kids do hold down minimum wage jobs.  So do inner
city kids, when give the chance.  Any reason you think that inner city kids
are incapable of doing legitimate work?
