This isn't really light pollution since it will only
be visible shortly before or after dusk (or during the
day).

European; those people speaking Indo-Eurpoean languages often have

please try to remember that there are more human activities than
those practiced by the Warrior Caste, the Farming Caste, and the
Priesthood.
And why act distressed that someone's found a way to do research
that doesn't involve socialism?
It certianly doesn't mean we deserve to die.
