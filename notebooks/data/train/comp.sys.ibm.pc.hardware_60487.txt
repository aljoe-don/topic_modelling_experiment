Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a 
clock, *has* to make a Get Date system call? Apparently, the clock
hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The
Get Date call notices that a "midnight reset" flag has been set, and then
then advances the date.
Anybody with more info?
