Article-I.D.: optilink.15236
Capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that
capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.
Slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not
in 1850.
This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments
would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the
North.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else
to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt
that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive
threat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the
maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local
governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside
capital investment in the Southern states.
