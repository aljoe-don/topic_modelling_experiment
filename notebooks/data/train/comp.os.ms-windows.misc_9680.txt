I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few 
questions about Windows for Workgroups.
I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with
Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. 1.1).
I am considering moving all our machines to W4WG.
     driver for the network card?
     still needed?
     machine is running its own licenced copy of W4WG? (Note: I do
     not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy
     of W4WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like
     to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. Returning one
     opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies.)
     all of Win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current
     Win 3.1 files?
     any troubles with the W4WG machines?
When I started this message, I was going to ask only 2 questions but I got carried
away. I'll stop now ;-).
I look forward to your replies.
