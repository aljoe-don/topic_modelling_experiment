From what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route
the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). Things
like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or
even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see
the sight of your computer going up in smoke! [Even ethernet cards are
protected. I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is
protected by a gas discharge tube!]
{But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings (i.e. in
controlled environments), it should be reasonably safe not to have
them.}
transceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include the
LT1080, LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251. The Maxims are suppose to be
electrically isolated ones but still need opto-isolators to work (don't
ask me why. I've never used them before.
Another alternative is an RS232 surge protector. Two are listed in the
RS catalogue. If you need additional info (i.e. stock nos.), just e-mail
me.
