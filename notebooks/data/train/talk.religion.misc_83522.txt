In a previous article, ba@mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu (B.A. Davis-Howe) says:
	Just wondering, do you mean the "Lectorium Rosicrucianum"?
Golden Dawn are you talking about?
	Just for the sake of argument, (reflecting NO affiliation)
I am going to say that the TRUE Rosicrucian Order is the Fraternitas
Rosae Crucis in Quakertown, Penn.,
	Any takers? :-)
Fraternally,
Tony
