Interesting discussion.
I limit myself to *one* 'standard serving' of alcohol if I'm
going to ride. And mostly, unless the alcohol is something
special (fine ale, good wine, or someone else's vsop), I usually
just don't drink *any*.
But then alcohol just isn't really important to me, mainly
for financial reasons...
At least one of the magazines claims to follow the
aviation guideline of "no alcohol whatsoever" within
24hrs of riding a 'company' bike.
Don't remember which mag though, it was a few years ago.
