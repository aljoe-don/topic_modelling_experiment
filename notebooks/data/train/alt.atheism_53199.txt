Bill, I hereby award you the Golden Shovel Award for the biggist pile of
bullshit I've seen in a whils. I'm afraid there's not a bit of religion in
macroevolution, and you've made a rather grand statement that Science can
not explain origins; to a large extent, it already has!
Peter W. Walker          "Yu, shall I tell you what knowledge is? When 
Dept. of Space Physics    you know a thing, say that you know it. When 
   and Astronomy          you do not know a thing, admit you do not know
Rice University           it. This is knowledge."
