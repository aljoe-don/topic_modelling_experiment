I don't know how accurate the documentary was; however, Koresh was never
convicted of any crimes against children, nor was the BATF after him for
child abuse.  Their purview (in this case) is strictly in firearms violations,
so this information is irrelevant to the discussion.
Those in charge will undoubtedly have to explain *something*, but whether
their answers even remotely resembles the truth we may never know.  And who
is left alive to care whether the prophecy is fulfilled?  It only holds
meaning for the nine who survived.
*IF* they confirm the story, I probably will.  Definitely not until then, 
however.
