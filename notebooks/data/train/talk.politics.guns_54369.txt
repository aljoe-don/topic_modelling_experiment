    Initial assault on the "compound" ( more like a wooden farm house if
  it burned to the ground like it did ) for WHAT?  Regardless of who
  started/caused the fire, NONE of this would have happened if the
  ATF can HONESTLY justify their initial assault and handled it 
  properly!  
   QUESTION AUTHORITY!

    Show me some evidenence instead of repeating what the FBI/ATF
  told you.
    Then I'm sure you won't mind if the ATF or the DEA raid your house
  someday on a bogus informant tip.  So what if they killed/wounded your 
  family "accidentally" during the raid, it's just a fair price to pay
  for law and order in this country, right?  Answer this question 
  honestly before making anymore ignorant statements!
    What is even more disturbing than out of control government agencies
  are citizens who allow them to be irresponsible.
