I don't know anything specifically, but I have one further anecdote. A
colleague of mine had a child with a serious congenital disease, tuberous
sclerosis. Along with mental retardation comes a serious seizure disorder.
The parents noticed that one thing that would precipitate a seizure was
a meal with corn in it. I have always wondered about the connection, and
further about other dietary ingredients that might precipitate seizures.
Other experiences would be interesting to hear about from netters.
