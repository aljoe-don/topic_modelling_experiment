	Hmm, sounds like a useful trick -- it'd keep the local cagers at least
a crutch-length off my tail-light, which is more than they give me now.  But
do I have to break a leg to use it?
	(When I broke my ankle dirt-biking, I ended up strapping the crutches
to the back of the bike & riding to the lab.  It was my right ankle, but the
bike was a GT380 and started easily by hand.)
