Never?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort
to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.
At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was
the chain was regarding the tanks "last used in Detroit in 48".
The text follows.
Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say
I had been told they did fire their main guns.  
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks
post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  
That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?
   --------------------------------------------------
  "I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns
to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively."
   --------------------------------------------------
  I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're
paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own
eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps
people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,
"bullshit filters".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.
  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:
  --------------------------------------------------
Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it
was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions
it in his song "Black Day in July".
  --------------------------------------------------
  Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that
means I was right.  
   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  
Awesley goes on:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.
John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. 
   Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an
authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it
had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an
authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged
massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.
Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but
the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was "several".  I've also
heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
assert that I claimed they were truth.
   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the 
difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 
years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.
So it would have been an Army cover-up.
   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building
were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and
am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.
   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe
that they did fire their guns.
   Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read
this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the
account I cited.
