   I don't know Rich. Last year when the congress was debating the Bushmans
'Crime Bill', the incident at Lubys' cafe occured. Most of the anti-gun
crap was amended out of the bill anyway. 
   
   Could a president 'order': go find some 'assault weapons' and bring the
media". I hope not.  Frankly, the Toon-meister* scares me. Of course 
having a Democratic majority in congress doesn't help. (Apologies to all 
Demos' who support RKBA)
( *definition: toon-meister - a characatureic name for the current 
president of the U.S.:   Clinton aka, Clintoon aka Toon-meister.)
