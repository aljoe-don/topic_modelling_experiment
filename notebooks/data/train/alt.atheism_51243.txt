Yes I fully agree with that, but is it "I don't believe gods exist", or
"I believe no gods exist"? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka)
pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word "believe" to mean.
Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak
atheism, at least according to the FAQ:
(From mathew's "An Introduction to Atheism" version 1.2 last modified 5-Apr-93)
Should the FAQ be clarified to try to pin down this notion of "belief"?
Can it?
