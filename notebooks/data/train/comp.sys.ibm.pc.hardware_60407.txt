There is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only
work as the first or second drive.  Any "built-in" drives e.g. IDE are
installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
as the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do.
The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the
scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I
have seen a similar situation before.
Good Luck
