C'mon, Tommy Soderstrom is having a fine rookie (I think he's a rookie)
season with the Flyers. I'm sure most of you knew that already, but just
in case.

A longtime, but realistic Ranger fan who's willing to admit that the Rangers
sucked big-time this year. They don't even deserve the luxury of a nice
golf course with a warm breeze. God, talk about underachievers!
