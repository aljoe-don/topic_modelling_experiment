Well well, they don't like our defenders (mainly Lumme and Numminen)...
Now, do YOU think that Ruuttu is only worth 16 ? I think it might be 20.
Compared to Kurri, Selanne's points are too high, lets make it 25 or 26.
Wow, now, it looks like you don't like our players? What about guys like:
Nieminen, Jutila, Riihijarvi, Varvio, Laukkanen, Makela, Keskinen and (even
if he is aging) Ruotsalainen? The main difference between finnish and North-
American players is, that our players tend to be better in the larger rink.
The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe. 
And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck (though
they helped). I think that the main reason was, that the team worked well
together.
