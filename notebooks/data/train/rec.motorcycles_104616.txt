Given my desire to stay as far away as possible from farming and ranching
equipment, I really hate to jump into this thread.  I'm going to anyway,
but I really hate it.
Ed, exactly what kind of mutant horse-like entity do you ride, anyway?
Does countersteering work on the normal, garden-variety, one-necked horse?
saw a small pseudo-ad for a book on hand signals appropriate to motorcycling.
It mentioned something about a signal for "Your passenger is on fire."  Any
body know the title and author of this book, and where I could get a copy?
This should not be understood as implying that I have grown sociable enough
to ride with anyone, but the book sounded cute.
