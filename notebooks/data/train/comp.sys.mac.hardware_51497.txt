	Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!! Sorry -- wrong. It would be an
extremely hot idea...at least with the current Alphas. The available
Alphas run up to 200 MHz. But they produce quite a bit of heat. In
fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat
sinks.
	Also Apple looks pretty commited to the PowerPC route instead
of a deal with DEC.
