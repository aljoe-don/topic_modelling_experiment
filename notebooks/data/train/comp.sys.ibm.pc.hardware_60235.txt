Two questions:
EISA motherboard (AIR) that has AMI bios..specifically I would like to set
the atclk or wait states or bus speed on this board, I can't seem to be
able to do it..any help in this area would be greatly appreciated.
am looking for jumper settings on a 5099EN24 drive..
Thanks in advance.
Tony
