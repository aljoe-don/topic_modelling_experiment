I dunno, Warren.  Just the other day I heard a rumor that "Serdar Argic"
(aka Hasan Mutlu and Ahmed Cosar and ZUMABOT) is not really a Turk at all,
but in fact is an Armenian who is attempting to make any discussion of the
massacres in Armenia of Turks so noise-laden as to make serious discussion
impossible, thereby cloaking the historical record with a tremendous cloud
of confusion.
