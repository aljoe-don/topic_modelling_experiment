Many of these cereals are corn-based. After your post I looked in the
literature and located two articles that implicated corn (contains
tryptophan) and seizures. The idea is that corn in the diet might
potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder, not cause it.
Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based. I'd be interested.
