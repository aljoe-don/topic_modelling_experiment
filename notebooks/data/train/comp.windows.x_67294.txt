The version I have is using the x256q code instead of the default X Windows
code.  I have it currently running on a DEC Alpha running OpenVMS AXP and
so far have been pretty impressed.  The only "side-effect" of x256q is that
it requires xstdcmap -best be run before it will work, annoyning but not a
show stopper.
