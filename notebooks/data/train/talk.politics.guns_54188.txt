       As a data point from Tennessee, a friend of mine and a police
officer essentially recommends that if you can, fade away.  Even if
you were perfectly justified you're likely in for a great deal of 
hassle.  (A side note, carrying a gun concealed is a misdemeanor.)
       It's one of those "by State" things, pretty much.
