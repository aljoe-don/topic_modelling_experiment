Lloyd Pettit married into Allen-Bradley Corp. (ab.com) family and owns the
Admirals.  He donated the Bradley Center and the new Pettit National Ice
Center.
This is not the way I have heard it.  See, Lloyd (as he is affectionately
referred to by Milwaukeeans and Bob Uecker) bought the Bradley Center *TO* get
the NHL to come here.
Yeah, the Bucks, the Milwaukee Wave (soccer), the Admirals, the Marquette
Warriors, concerts and a bunch of other things...
