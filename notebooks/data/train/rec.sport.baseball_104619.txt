I nominate this last bit for "Anti-Stathead Quote of the Week".
Alomar only has a 50 point advantage in the most important offensive
category, while Baerga, who studied in the Joe Carter School of Out-Burning,
has more impressive mediot stats, largely due to opportunities rather
than quality.
The lines are fairly close in value, but edge to Alomar.
Now Baerga ain't chopped liver, but Alomar is still the man to beat among
AL second basemen...
