 I know this is a little weird, but I know that World magazine (you know,
National Geo. for children) did a very simple and concise article on Kirlian
photography.  They had some neat pictures, too.  A friend of mine's mother had
a book on Kirlian photography, only it's photographs took a radiologist to 
interpret.  They (World magazine) warned us all that it was very dangerous,
probably to stop curious children from experimenting with it.  Mind you, this
was 10 years ago, at least.  (And boy, does that say something about my age)
