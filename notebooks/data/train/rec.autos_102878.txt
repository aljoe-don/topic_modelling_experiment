Nobody is using discrete IC's to do these functions anymore if at
all.  I doubt any of the Motor electronics had any to start with.
...Much less TTL.
I can almost guarantee that it'll a fruitless attempt to figure out
how BMW does it without breaking anything and invalidating any
warranty  on the car.  If you're lucky, you'd still be able to
start the car.
