how so? i think you're making assumptions here that might not 
necessarily be true. -my- personal choice would be a semi-auto, but 
revolvers are just as effective, if not more so.
relevancy, please? you sound shocked, but that hardly proves anything.
wait, doesn't Chicago have -serious- gun control? if so, why do the
police need all that firepower in the first place? (sarcasm alert)
all the patrol cars i've seen around here have shotguns clamped to 
the dash board. IMHO, that's all the police need to outgun just about 
anything.
