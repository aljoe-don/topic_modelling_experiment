Well, like someone said in a reply to this it really all depends on the area
that you live in.  See David Veal's reply to this.  I have heard exactly the
same thing that he said in his reply - to fade away if you think that you
haven't been seen (I heard this from a police officer).  For the record though
he was talking about in Tennessee - not everywhere.
