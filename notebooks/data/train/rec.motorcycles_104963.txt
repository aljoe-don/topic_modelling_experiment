I was laughing about the law part.
I've driven thru SOHO...manahattan, _I_ know what' you're talking 'bout...
Not that Durham, NC is any better...
(well, maybe a little bit anyway, but the NC DOT takes more
money from road taxes and puts it in their own pockets and
into the pockets of the guys building the large condos that
need their own roads than they do back into fixing roads, but
hey, the local paper did a report of this last summer, and 
boy, am I glad I don't work for the DOT, 'cause they got SHAT
on, bigtime....wonder who lost their jobs?  ED?  Got any idea?)
