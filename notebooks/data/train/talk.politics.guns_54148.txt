	Why?  Either the numerator or the denominator could fluctuate.
	The dollar value of a gun would (of course)
	go up if supply were restricted.  The weight of a gun might
	go down significantly as technology improved.   I don't
	think you have a basis to assert this.  
	
	The skill is easily taught to anyone with a modicum of
	mechanical aptitude and the ONLY motivator needed is 
	money.  If guns were banned then this motivator would kick
	in big time.  Now, of course, it is not a moneymaking
	proposition for every machine shop to make guns on the
	side when it ain't rebuilding engines.  Ban guns and 
	watch what happens.  You'll have to schedule a year in advance
	to get your brakes resurfaced. ;-)
