Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it

the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it
created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't
shorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying
around that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it
being more than 50 cents!.
Well, needless to say, the TV still works today.  So go get a set of
schematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking around
the flyback.
