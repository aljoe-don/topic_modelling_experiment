day  
Brent shows his ignorance once again.  Power had been cut for weeks.  And he's  
never lived in a rural area if he thinks electric stoves have favor there.   
They stop working when the power fails, and power restoration come MUCH slower  
in the country, than the city.  LP gas stoves and ovens are very much prefered.
