XDM is not just an X Window client.  XDM has its own protocol (XDMCP) that
operates of UCP on port 177.  It does provide a Login window which is an
X Window Client.  As to using DECnet protocol.  Looking through the source
for XDM from X11R5 that I have here, it seems that the bare bones code is
there but not completely there.
From my look at the source, it seems you cannot run it over DECnet as shipped
with X11R5.
