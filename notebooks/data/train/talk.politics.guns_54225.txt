  Koresh had a lawyer, Deguin(?) who he spoke to in person several times during
the last few weeks. 
  This strikes me as a tad ingenous.  "If X had done/note done Y, then Z would
never have happened."  I tend to place tha responsibility on the group/person
actually committing the act, not on those whon "forced them to do it".
  After all, to take an extreme example, if the British were not in Northern
Ireland, the IRA would not be forced to place bombs in shopping centers.
  That said, this whole sorry story was a totally unecessary, utterly fucked
up mess from the get go.
