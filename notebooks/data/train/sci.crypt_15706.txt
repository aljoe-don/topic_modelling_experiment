You're right, and I retract the suggestion.  Still, I wonder.  That
there are only 60 bits of key information should, in principle, be
detectable.  Maybe some variant of the tests Rivest et al. did to
demonstrate that DES was probably not a group?  It should make an
interesting paper -- a black-box analysis of a cryptosystem.
