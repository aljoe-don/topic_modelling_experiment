How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?
If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel
active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device.
So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how
all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
to the ISA-AT bus at the same time.
Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,
but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):
"The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board
direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers."
I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.  
So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT
HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense.
