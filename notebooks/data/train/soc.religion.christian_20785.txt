Some years ago an Anglican synod was discussing the marriage canons and 
there was some debate on what actually constituted a marriage.
The bishop of Natal, whose wife of many years had died, and who had recently 
remarried, announced "It MUST be consummated" and looked like that cat that 
got the cream.
So I suppose he at least would agree with you.
