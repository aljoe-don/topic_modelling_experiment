Since one is also unlikely to get "the truth" from either Arab or 
Palestinian news outlets, where do we go to "understand", to learn? 
Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another? The only way 
to determine that is to try and get beyond the writer's "political
agenda", whether it is "on" or "against" our *side*.
