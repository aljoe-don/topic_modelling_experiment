I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.
It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.
No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing
so loudly, that it's quite remarkable that I was able to come
to a stop with the rubber side up.
The duck, BTW, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both
sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.
The bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to
my belly button.

struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing
