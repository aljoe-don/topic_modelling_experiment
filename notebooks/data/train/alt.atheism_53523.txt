  I shall try to get hold of it (when I have time to read of course :-)
    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from
science.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into
your mouth either). 
   But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can
not make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.
   Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to
be scientific treatises. So I am just requesting the theists to stop making
such wild claims.
