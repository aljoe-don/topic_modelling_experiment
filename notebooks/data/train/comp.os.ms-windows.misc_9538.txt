	Can anyone tell me how Chicago/Windows 4 would differ from
OS/2 2.x?  Believe it or not, I'm not trying to start a flame war,
here.   I'm simply curious  if there is going to be any feature
advantage in either of these products (I do not consider the fact that
it has uncle bills seal of approval much of a feature...)
