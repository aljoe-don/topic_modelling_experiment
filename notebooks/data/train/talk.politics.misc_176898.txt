Article-I.D.: optilink.15216
If you don't want to be lumped together as a group, stop insisting
on being treated as a member of a group.
Sexual orientation is not defined by the anti-discrimination law
that was passed last year.  Pedophilia isn't a sexual orientation?
I wholeheartedly support their right to take this action.  I wouldn't
do it myself, unless it was something like the NAMBLA T-shirt.
I support their right to do so (just like I support your right to 
engage in sodomy with consenting adults), but I think they are doing 
something wrong.  I wouldn't do business with such a bank.
Here's the law that was passed and signed by the governor:
     The people of the State of California do enact as follows:
 1       SECTION 1.  The purpose of this act is to codify
 2  existing case law as determined in Gay Law Students v.
 3  Pacific Telephone and Telegraph, 24 Cal. 3d 458 (1979)
 4  and Soroka v. Dayton Hudson Corp., 235 Cal. App. 3d 654
 5  (1991) prohibiting discrimination based on sexual
 6  orientation.
 7       SEC. 2.  Section 1102. is added to the Labor Code, to
 8  read:
 9       1102.1.  (a) Sections 1101 and 1102 prohibit
10  discrimination or disparate treatment in any of the terms
11  and conditions of employment based on actual or
12  perceived sexual orientation.
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
13       (b)  This section shall not apply to a religious
14  association or corporation not organized for private
15  profit, whether incorporated as a religious or public
16  benefit corporation.
