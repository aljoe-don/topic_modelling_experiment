There was a news article a little while ago reporting a type of car (was
it a Volvo?) was found to stall if you used a certain brand/model of cellular
phone in it.  I seem to remember the car was recalled to fix the problem.
Hmmmmm... this has possibilities:
If the police are in pursuit of a vehicle, maybe they can bombard it with
high energy RFI.  :-)
