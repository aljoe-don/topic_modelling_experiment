I can relate to this. I've tried everything on my 86, greasing every point,
WD40, etc. Grease on the two cheap hinges on the tailgate seems to quiet it
down for a time, until the grease works out of the hinges. (Hinge pins appear
to be made out of 16 penny nails!) 
Another vibration seems to get worse with age, and that is a vibration in the
transmission in 4th gear. My S10 has 59K miles on it. I bought it new, treated
it very easily, no fast off-road stuff. Can't GM build Chevies like they used
to? Ford Explorers look nice, until you look at the price.
