Actually, I am *completely* baffled by why Dorothy Denning has chosen
to throw away her academic respectability like this.  It looks to me
like a *major* Career Limiting Move.  There can be very few people
who know what she's been saying who take her seriously any more.
I wonder if she landed such a fat fee from cooperation with the NSA in
the design and propoganda stages that she doesn't care any more?
