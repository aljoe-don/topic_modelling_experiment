But waiiiiiit, isn't Nissan officially registering the car as far as
government paperwork goes, Nissan Stanza Altima, to avoid costly and
lengthy paperwork? I read this on the net a while ago, and someone
actually may have said there's a little Stanza logo on the Altima
somewhere.
You *can* have it both ways :-)
