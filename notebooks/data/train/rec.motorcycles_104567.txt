Look, guy, I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving, but if
he's been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to
lighten up? I mean, it isn't like most of us haven't had a few
and then ridden or driven home. *We* just didn't get caught.
And I can speak for myself and say it will *never* happen again,
but that is beside the point.
In answer to the original poster: I'd insure whatever vehicle
is cheapest, and can get you to and from work, and suffer
through it for a few years, til your rates drop.
And *don't* drink and drive. I had one friend killed by a 
drunk, and I was rear ended by one, totaling my bike (bent
frame), and only failing to kill me because I had an eye
on my mirror while I waited at the stoplight.
