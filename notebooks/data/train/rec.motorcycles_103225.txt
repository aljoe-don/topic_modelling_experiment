Yeah, hypothermia is MUCH more detrimemtal to your judgement and reactions
than people realise. I wish I had the patience to stop when I should. One
day I'll pay for it....
If you  begin to shiver - STOP and warm up thoroughly. If you leave it
till the shivering stops, this doesnt mean you're OK again, it means 
you're a danger to yourself and everyone else on the road - your brain
and body are working about as fast as a tree grows. You will not realise
this yourself till you hit something. The next stage is passing out. 
This usually means falling off.
