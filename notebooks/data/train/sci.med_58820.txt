You don't say whether or not you have any symptoms other than pain.
If you have numbness, weakness or bladder problems, for example,
these would suggest a need for surgery. If pain is your only symptom
you might do well to find a reputable, multi-disciplinary pain
clinic in your area. Chronic low back pain generally doesn't do well
with surgery, acute on chronic pain (as only symptom) doesn't fare
much better.
e correlation between MRI findings and symptoms is controversial.
