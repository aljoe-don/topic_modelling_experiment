It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand 
miles.  I don't know why.  I've had three new K bikes, and all three used a
bit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles; this soon quits
and by the time I had 10,000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero.
I've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner
it stops using any oil.
