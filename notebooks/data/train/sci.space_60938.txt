I was assuming that there won't be a moon base unless it makes a
profit, actually.  If it does, well, that gives a larger GNP which
leads to being able to spend more money on your military, including
gosh-wow space stuff.  (assuming it's profitable, rather than paying
for itself.)
You might be able to _run_ one for that; put it there, hardly.
Why do you think at least a couple centuries before there will
be significant commerical activity on the Moon?
