Only if you have a weeny insurance company. Unless it's
some stupid PA law.  I know that if some jerk hits me while 
I'm in a parking lot, if my insruance company doesn't sue
his (or his doesn't immediately say, 'Yes, it's his fault')
I'll sure him myself and tell my insurance company to go to
hell if they raise my rates.
