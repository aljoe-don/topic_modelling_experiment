"The only proposals in the Senate that I         "My opinions do not represent
have seen fit to mention are particularly        those of my employer or
praiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones.    any government agency."

and to deter evil words and deeds with the
fear of posterity's damnation."
- Tacitus, _Annals_ III. 65
