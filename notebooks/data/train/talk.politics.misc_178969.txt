What kind of brainless clod posted the above garbage? Would they be
so kind as to explain how this is "Clinton's" initiative, when it
has been before Congress for "at least the past 6 months"?
Jeez, the next thing you know, they'll be blaming the weather on the
poor guy. They'll be blaming World War II on him. They'll be blaming
the Civil War on him. Maybe the Thirty Years War?
