I own a del Sol and I must vouch for the interior.  I really looks snazzy when
the top is off.  I looks a lot better in person than on the television.  (I saw
that Motorweek as well.  Needless to say I was smiling a bit by the time it
was over ...)  :*)
Watch out for that darned "convertible tan" tho...
