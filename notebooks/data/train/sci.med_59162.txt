Speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center, the above
behavior is completely inappropriate. If a patient who requires extensive
care shows up at the last minute, we always see them and give them appropriate
care. It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its
posted hours, but what you describe is misbehavior. Ask to speak to the
clinic director, and complain. Whatever their attitude, they have nothing to
gain from angering patients.
