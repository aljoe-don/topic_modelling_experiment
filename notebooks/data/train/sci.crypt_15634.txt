I was responding to another person (Tarl Neustaedter) who held that the
EFF wasn't the best organization to fight for crytography rights since the
EFF also supports the right to distribute pornography over the internet,
something some Crypto people might object to. In other words, he's
implying that there are people who will protect any speech, just  as long
as it is encrypted.
