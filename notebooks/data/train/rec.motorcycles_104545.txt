Easy Rider (harleys, drugs, rednecks, New Orleans), Mad Max (violence, DoD 
wanna-be's), Time Rider (Honda Thumper, Time travel), On Any Sunday 
(Documentary about dirtbike racers, GREAT!), The (Great?) Escape (Steve 
Mcqueen, Nazis), Rebel Without a Cause (James Dean, future DoD'ers).  I 
think the last two are right, they are OLD movies I haven't seen in YEARS.
