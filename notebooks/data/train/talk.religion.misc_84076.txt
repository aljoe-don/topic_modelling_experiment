I understand that they had the neccessary licenses and permits to own
automatic weapons.  
I haven't seen any proof (or even evidence) that the BD's had broken the
law.  If you have proof (or evidence), let's hear it.  "The FBI said so" is
NOT evidence.
I guess there will always be people who wish to be peasants.  The politicians
prefer unarmed peasants
