MSG is mono sodium glutamate, a fairly straight forward compound. If it is
pure, the source should not be a problem. Your comment suggests that 
impurities may be the cause.
My experience of MSG effects (as part of a double blind study) was that the
pure stuff caused me some rather severe effects.
Soya bean, fermented cheeses, mushrooms all contain MSG. 
The symptoms I had were numbness of jaw muscles in the first instance
followed by the arms then the legs, headache, lethargy and unable to keep
awake. I think it may well affect people differently.
