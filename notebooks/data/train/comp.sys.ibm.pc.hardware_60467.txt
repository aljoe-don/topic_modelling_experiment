There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer
to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be
programmed that way anyways, so there probably isin't a problem with this)
Besides, like I said before, the FDD controller uses DMA channel #2.
And I don't yet believe that the HDD controllers (any of them, MFM, RLL,
etc) don't also use DMA.
