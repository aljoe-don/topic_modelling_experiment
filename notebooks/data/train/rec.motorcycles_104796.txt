I'll second that!! I saw a list somewhere of all the stuff that it was 
unwise to buy secondhand - stuff like parachutes, toilet paper, condoms
and motorcycle helmets...
Seriously though, why take the risk? You are extremely unlikely to get
a good-fitting secondhand helmet, cos life just doesn't work like that!
And as Lisa says, you never know where it's been before...
