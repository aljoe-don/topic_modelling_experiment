    Lets carry this one step further. Suppose the text of the key is
in itself conclusive evidence of the SAME CRIME for which the
encrypted material is further evidence. I find myself envisaging a
scenario like this:
You have made some scans of Peanuts strips. You encrypt them. The key
is a phrase.
The Comic Police haul you in. They seize your system. They find the
encrypted file.

	tend to incriminate me of breaking laws, independent of what 
	may or may not be in the encrypted file."  
	itself"
	the file encoded with this keyphrase contains illegal scans of 
        copyrighted Peanuts strips.""
Judge and CP: "Oh."
     How will they get you now? I'm not saying that they won't, or
can't (or even that they shouldn't :-), but what legal mechanism will
they use? Should we be crossposting this to misc.legal?
