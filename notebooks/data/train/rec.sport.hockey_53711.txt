Hmmm...I also heard through the grapevine that Team Finland might try and
leave a spot open for at least one NHLer. (Some guy named Sel{nne, ever
hear of him? :)  They might have to be content with Kurri, though, I hope. :)
Daryl Turner : r.s.h contact for the Winnipeg Jets 
Tkachuk over to Zhamnov, up to Sel{nne, he shoots, he scores! 
The Jets win the Cup!  The Jets win the Cup!
Essensa for Vezina!  Housley for Norris!  Sel{nne for Calder!
