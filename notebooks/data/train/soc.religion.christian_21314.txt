In many places, Christians were sucessful in their attempts
to get the films banned, or at least given a very restrictive 
showing.
I have no problem with Christians burning their own pieces of
art (though I find it a tragic waste). I do however have a 
problem with their attempts to censor what I may or may not
view.
