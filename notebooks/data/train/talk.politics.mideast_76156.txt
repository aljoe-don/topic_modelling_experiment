The American people didn't have any problem with it too (Clinton). Actually I
think that it does not make any difference as long as they have the
qualifications to become leaders. BTW in my political view I hope  (and should be 
the Arab hope too) that Binyamin Netanyahu will not be ellected as prime minister 
of Israel.
