Yes - ignore the manual.  Just insert the evelope - don't use the keypad
to move it up.  The Windows driver sends a message to the printer that
tells it to load the envelope - if it is already loaded, it gets ejected
and the printer tries to load another.  The instructions in the manual
are for dumb DOS apps. that don't send the "load envelople" message.
