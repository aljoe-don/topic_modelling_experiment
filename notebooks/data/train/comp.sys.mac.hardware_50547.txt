I also returned PB memory last summer for credit, and the sales person warned
me not to use US mail.  I did (although I did insure the shipment), and 
apparently Techworks got it.
My minor grip with techworks is that they have different price lists for
different people.  I ordered DUO memory, thinking I got their "best" price
because of my employeer.  I subsequently found out that Apple was offering
developers memory for less than techworks charged, called up to complain,
and was told I should have said I was an apple developer and they credited
my card for about 16% of the purchase price.   I like techworks quality
and installation instructions (and they include powerbook tools), but 
for out-of-CA purchases (no sales tax) chip merchant seems to be a bit less.
