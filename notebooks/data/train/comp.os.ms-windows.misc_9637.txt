There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC
processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is 
not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to
swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications.
As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between
a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.
This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors, Intel has 
certainly proved that.
What I want to know, is what does this have to do with this group?
