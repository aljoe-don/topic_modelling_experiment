Sound like the pilot circuit was say lean/clogged.  I don't think
water would cause a problem like this, but?
See above.  Were you by chance coasting when it stuck?  On a two stroke
you only have (substantial) lubrication when you are giving the bike gas.
If it was lean on the pilot, that's why it stuck.
You mentioned an aftermarket carb?  (I deleted the text)  Looks like 
(to me) that's where your problem is.
