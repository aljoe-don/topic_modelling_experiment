Carrying in the glove box is not covered...I'm not sure what I was 
thinking there. It _is_ legal in Oklahoma. 
On inter-state travel, as long as it is legal for you to own
at your point of origination and destination, the gun is carried
in a locked compartment/box (glove box specifically excluded) separate
from the ammo, it is legal under Title 19, Chapter 44, Section 94(9? I
forget, and my copy of the regs is at home) of the US Code. This,
unfortunately, has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a
certain state (which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly
stupid) under that state's law.
Gee, and I thought Federal Law overrode state law...
