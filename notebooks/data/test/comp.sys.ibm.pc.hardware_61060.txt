I'm arguing with the phone company about a similar problem.  We
installed a second phone line in our home (for our kids), and whenever
one of them is on THEIR line, the modem returns "NO DIAL TONE" on its
line.
When we pick up the phone and listen, we can hear my kids' voices
"bleed" through.  Whenever we can hear this, the modem won't dial (even
though the dial tone is loud and clear through the modem speaker).
I think it's the phone company's problem, but they say they can't
(won't?) correct the problem...I'm still working on them. ;-}
