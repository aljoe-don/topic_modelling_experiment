I suggest we start with the ubiquitous Sun, to get a lot of momentum
going.  Custom hardware isn't going to go anywhere until there's a
user base.
Count me in.  I need someone at the US end to experiment on the 
protocols with, and I like the way you code.  Give me 3 weeks to
move house and settle in then we'll go for it seriously...
