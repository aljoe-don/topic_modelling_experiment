The use of shock waves (not ultrasound) to break up stones has been
around for a few years.  Depending on the type of machine, and intensity
of the shock waves, it is usually uncomfortable enough to require
something...  The high-power machines cause enough pain to require
general or regional anesthesia.  Afterwards, it feels like someone
slugged you pretty good!
