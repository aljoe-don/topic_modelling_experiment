Talk to Philip Greenspun. He took Ford to court recently and, despite much
manouvering and trickery on Ford's part, he won! Well, actually I think
Ford settled out of court on the provision he shut his mouth and stopped 
causing them trouble. I love it when the little guy wins. I don't have
Philip's address anymore, but a "Philip, where are you" call may bring him
out of hiding.
Cheers,
Paul.
