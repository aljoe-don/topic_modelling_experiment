It is the radiated signal that would cause the problem.
There is nothing in the Amateur Radio Tests that requires an technical
competence at all. It is a simple matter to memorize all the questions
and answers.  However, that said, most Hams that I know do spend quite
a bit of time gaining some technical skill.
Don't count on that.
You cannot do that legally. However, you can ask a ham over to listen.
If the interference occurs at a specific time each day, then it would
be possible to do such scheduling.  If nothing else, you could invite
the ham over to transmit from your driveway, to see if he interferes.
If he does, then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to
make it immune to rf interference.
The FCC may, or may not, have such information. They have enough to do
without getting calls for such information. If nothing else, call your
city offices or police department (general business number). They should
have the name of a local ham contact.
See above - your concept of wasted signal is erroneous. If his rig is
transmitting properly, then the chance of interference (with the exception
of harmonic television interference) is the greatest - since he is putting
out the strongest signal.
Unfortunately, most consumer equipment is succeptable - it is all poorly
designed.
It does, but not for a mobile radio. There are very few mobile rigs that
could power a 1500 watt amplifier.
