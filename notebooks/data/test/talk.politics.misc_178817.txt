You are correct, I apologize.  My problems with the AEC are their (however inherent)
continuous barage of misleading data in order to support the statement
that nuclear is not only "safe and clean" but cheap to boot.  10 to 15 cents per
kilowatt hour is not cheap and neither are nuclear power plants.  As far as
being safe and clean - I'll let nuclear power plants speak for themselves all
the way from the uranium mines to their decommisioning.
