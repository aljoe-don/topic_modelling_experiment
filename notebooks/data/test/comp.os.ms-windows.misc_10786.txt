Excellent suggestion, Ron.  And as a further comment on DOS 6, if
you decide to install Windows standalone configuration completely,
in more than 1 directory on your hard drive, and use DOS 6 to
jump to a specific copy for each user, you could be saving yourself
many megs of disk space if you use the SETUP /N and /A technique!!
