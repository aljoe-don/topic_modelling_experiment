I have, my thesis was on Sun Tzu.
More to the point:
Those who are called the good militarists of old, could make opponents
lost contact between front and back lines, lose reliability between
large and small groups, lose mutual concern for the welfare of the
different social classes among them, lose mutual accomodation between
the rulers and the ruled, lose enlistments among the soldiers, lose
coherence within the armies.  They went into action when it was
advantageous, stopped when it was not.
Today it is.  Sitting on your hands will get you nowhere in this battle.
