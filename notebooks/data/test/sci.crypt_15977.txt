Ouch!  Thanks for trying it.
Yes.  I'm not sure if my xposting to comp.speech made it to here too, but
I've found that a low sample rate (3300 samples/sec at 8 bits per sample)
plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get
speech into 14.4K with a simdgen left over.  This is *definitely* worth
working on, folks.  And shorten works in well under real-time.
