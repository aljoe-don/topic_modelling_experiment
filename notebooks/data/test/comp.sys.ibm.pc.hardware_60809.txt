I ran into the same problem when I upgraded from a 2400 modem to a 14400
modem. Any time I give the modem a reset command [ATZ] while, in windows.
The computer locks up. If I give the ATZ command in DOS, it will work. My solution 
was to not give the modem the [ATZ] command thru windows. In the PROCOMM +
install process I told the program I have a hayes compatible 2400 modem. ATZ
was not included in the initialization string & it works fine. I called MS
about this, & they didn't have a clue as to what the memory/interupt conflict 
could be. The lockup accures using ANY windows comm program that gives the ATZ
command.
