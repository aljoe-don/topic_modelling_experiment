Although I'm neither Fundamentalist nor Evangelical, I have often noticed
this trend in the media.  In short, it is permissable to bash Fundamentalists.
No need to substitue a nationality such as "Mexican..." try simply to 
substitute a different religion "...raised by Muslim parents," or "...raised
by Jewish parents..."  The paper simply would not do this.
