Any death is serious.  Wanna discuss match control?  Firearms related  
unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under are the fault of one or  
more negligent persons, not the gun.
Providing false hope, then, is the intent?
200% increase in California schools, eh?  Gun control is working fine, there!
So your religion is different.  Does that make it his wrong?  Even assuming  
Koresh actually made that decision, and the verdict is still out on that.
