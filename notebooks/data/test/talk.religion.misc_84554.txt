All right. I'm not and won't be lawyer. What about doctors?
I going to fly aeroplane (or drive car). Doctors have to look for different
kind of illnesses in me before I get permission to fly an aeroplane.
They have burden of proof that "harmful illnesses don't exist in me",
do they ?
(I'm just questioning my belief that believers have the burden of proof.)
Oh!  Are you those bug-generator C-programmers  ? :-)
