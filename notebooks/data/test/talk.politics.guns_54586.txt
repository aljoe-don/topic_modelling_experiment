This is, apparently, what passes for intelligent discourse at Trinity.
Joe "FBI cultist" Kusmierczak gets angry when its pointed out that
the FBI has told him is a LIE, the mounting evidence is that 
they've lied about almost every detail of 4/19 except that they
were there. What can you expect of cultists like him, somebody
oughtta burn him out, and if he's trapped, well, good riddance!
Right Joe?
