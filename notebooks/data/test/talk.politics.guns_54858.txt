The IRS doesn't need to rely on the Federal Marshall's Services; the
IRS has its own Swat teams. I saw a picture of one in an article on
the IRS in some magazine or other.

The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens.  Just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. The
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom.
