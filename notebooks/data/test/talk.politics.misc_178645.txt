Of course it helps,  but only if the decision to involve third parties
is the primary partis' to make.  A corrupt and ignorant third party
isn't going to say,  "we're corrupt and ignorant,  we'll stay out of this".
Pointing out that they are corrupt and ignorant won't help,  they either
won't believe you or won't care.
Look,  somebody has to have the power to decide whether a third party
will regulate your transactions or not.  That somebody is going to
be either you or the third party.  You can argue until you are
blue in the face that regulators shouldn't get involved (in fact,  people
have tried this),  they won't listen.    The fundamental question you
have to ask is,  whose decision is it whether or not to involve regulators,
ours or theirs?  After you've answered thed first question,  you can
try to move on to such questions as "should regulators be involved" and,  if
so,  "what regulations are appropriate?"  Although with your answer to
the first question,  the second and third are taken out of your hands.
