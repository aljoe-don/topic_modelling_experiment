True enough, but...
Zilog SCC:
---------
	RR0[7]:  Break Detect
This is a very popular part, but it has a number of quirks, especially
in HDLC mode.
Signetics 68562 DUSCC:
---------------------
	RSR[2]:  Break Start Detect
	RSR[3]:  Break End Detect
Two of the bits in the Receiver Status Register.  You can enable an interrupt
on either of these bits going high, too.  Also, only one NULL will be put
in the FIFO per break detected.
This is simply the best serial chip I've ever worked with.  _Many_ less
quirks than the SCC, which is IMHO second-best.  (Death to 8250 devices!)
