To decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of
the limiter-current and the allowed temp-drift.
In the first case, you can use a Ube of a transistor as a voltage-reference
of about 0.7 VDC with a temp-drift of 2mV/K. In the second case its better
you use a bandgap-ref and a opamp-circuit to detect the maximum-current.
The output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current.
