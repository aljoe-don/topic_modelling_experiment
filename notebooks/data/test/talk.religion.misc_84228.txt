O.K., got you.  I concede your point, though the word "obliged" strongly
implies that one must sometimes use force.  A further rephrasing would
give you the distinction you mention, however.  If I have you right, a pacifist
would not even go on to say, "unfortunately,etc."
Yes, fair enough, though why confuse things by saying that "one is 
somtimes obliged" if the real meaning is that "one is never obliged".
If you don't think that it is "immoral, period.".
