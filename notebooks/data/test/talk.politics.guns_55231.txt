Ah, here Freeman is being prejudiced (look it up and see what I mean Freeman).
Here Freeman is pre-judging someone before he knows all of the facts.  Guess
it can happen to the best (and in his case the worst) of us.
Freeman thinks I am behind when actually I am quite on top of things.  The
point he seems to be missing now is that after a certain point accuracy can be
very tedious and ridiculous.  See Freeman's next post for an explanation.
