It isn't bogus.  I had chronic vaginal yeast infections that would go away
with cream but reappear in about 2 weeks.  I had been on 3 rounds of
antibiotics for a resistant sinus infection and my husband had been on
amoxicillin also for a sinus infection.  After six months of this, I went
to a gynecologist who had me culture my husband seminal fluid.  After 7
days incubation he had quite a bit of yeast growth (it was confirmed by
the lab).  A round of Nizerol for him cleared both of us.
