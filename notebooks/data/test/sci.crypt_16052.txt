        There's a better way. Doesn't Qualcom have a secure design
        that it decided not to market?  Since they aren't going to
        use it, wouldn't the patriotic thing be to put the design in
        the public domain? How about selling a "Cryptography
        Educational Kit" with the critical parts? Something that could
        end up as a PC option board with two phone jacks?
        Cheers,
                Marc
