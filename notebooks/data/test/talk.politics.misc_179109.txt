I think Mr. Kaldis was using the expression in the slang sense,
though I agree it is NOT an appropriate expression to use in this
context.
1. That homosexual men are extremely promiscuous, and homosexual women
are, if any more promiscuous than heterosexual women, it's not by
much.
2. That homosexual men are overrepresented among child molesters 
(about 30% of child molestation is done by homosexual or bisexual
men), while homosexual women don't appear to be similarly over-
represented.
