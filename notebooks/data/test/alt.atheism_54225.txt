Okay all humans are direct descendents of of a bunch of hopeful
monsters. The human race didn't evolve from one set parents, but from
thousands. Do you really base your atheist on -this-?
Did I say that people were Christians by nature or did I say that
Christians hold that everyone knows of the God the Christians worship.
I would have thought the distinction obvious, sorry. Read my post
again and see what I -really- said; from what you've written, I think
you are just being agumentative. Also your word-wrap is screwed up or
you need to shift to 80 columns text ...
