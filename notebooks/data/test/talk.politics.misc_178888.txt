I was quoting a news story.  I have no idea why they claim this was
the most "through examination."
WHAT?  Even in San Francisco, the Dept. of Public Health estimates
that only 11% of the male population is gay.  What you are claiming
is that of the 16 million people in the NYC and LA areas, that more
than 10% are gay.  What is the source of your numbers?  Keep in
mind that attempts by CDC to determine homosexual percentage in
American cities have given numbers <3%.
Yes, your 1.75 million number smells funny.
