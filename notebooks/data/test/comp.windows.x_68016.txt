This would be tedious, but if you have the time you could get the .bdf
file (I can email it to you if you don't have it or don't have easy access 
to the X source), and could make your own bold font from this.  Since each
glyph is just a bitmap, you could write a program to convert each
glyph to a bitmap-readable file, use bitmap to make each glyph "bold", and
convert the results back to .bdf format.  Then, use "bdftopcf" to create
the .pcf file.  Then, stick the .pcf in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc (or wherever)
and include it in fonts.dir and, voila, you'll have what you need!
