Well, the 1.6 IS music to my ears. I often turn my stereo off and just run
it towards red line on nice twisty roads. But Toyota engines at idle have
a strange "bells and whisstles at the bottom of a matal can" sound. I can't
describe it any better.
Just like all the older Benzes have a very characteristic clattering sound
at idle. Do you know what I'm referring to?
