It is for a business and the end product has to be a photograph.
I take damaged black and whites, usually old, some very, and repair them
by hand at present.  I would like to do this by using a computer.
I am just trying to find a vendor who can convert my computer stored
images to negatives or thermal print.  The customer will want his/her
copy as much as possible like a brand new original photgraph.

ps. Thanks to all of you who have sent me information it was very
    helpful in my learning about computers combined with photography.
    If anyone else has any information I would be grateful.
