Devorski unfortunately helped to taint an otherwise brilliant display
by MacLean.  The Canucks tied up the Jets so tightly that I thought that
they were mailing them.
BTW, Greg...next time, don't fall asleep in geography class, it's pretty
sad when a fellow in Norway can spell Winnipeg properly and a guy in
North America can't.
One more thing...how LONG has Vancouver been in the NHL?  How many
championships do they have?  
Oh yeah...and I CAN go to the Arena and see not one, not two, but
*six* championship banners hanging from the rafters.  3 Stanley Cup
banners, and 3 Avco Cup banners.  My NHL guide says that Vancouver has
won the Cup once (as many times as the rockin' town of Kenora has won it!)
Daryl Turner : r.s.h contact for the Winnipeg Jets 
Tkachuk over to Zhamnov, up to Sel{nne, he shoots, he scores! 
The Jets win the Cup!  The Jets win the Cup!
Essensa for Vezina!  Housley for Norris!  Sel{nne for Calder!
