My 610 is working great.  I haven't heard of any problems.  Sounds
to me like your dealer doesn't know what he's talking about.  It's
pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the Centris 610 on the basis
of problems with one machine.  Recommending the IIvx over the LCIII
doesn't make a lot of sense either.  If this person is so convinced the 610
is buggy have they talked to Apple about it or are they just assuming
it's a problem with all of them?
