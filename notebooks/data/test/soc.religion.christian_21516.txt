And as someone mentioned earlier, from the apocryphal Book of Enoch,
satan was apparently kicked out for three times asserting his own will,
"I will".  Hmmm...pro-choice looks kinda creepy here.
Then there are the references around the Bible about taking a third
of the angels, getting a third of the heavens or something.
