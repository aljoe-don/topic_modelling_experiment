Nope.  Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the
long cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  I
would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short
peaks.
You can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or try
strapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out,
which will minimize the line drop.  If these don't work, though, you're
going to need a bigger generator.
I assume that you're using well-maintained generators, and have watched the
voltage output on the generator properly.  If you don't have 120V coming out
of the unloaded generator you'll never get 120V at the other end.
I recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of
work, and not with the pro-audio people.  Also, I recommend that you don't
try to tap into junction boxes at all, but hire a licensed electrician if
you don't really know what you are doing.  I've had to clean up after two
people who nearly killed themselves playing in hot 200A boxes, and it wasn't
much fun.
