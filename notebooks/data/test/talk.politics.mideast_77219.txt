	I disagree.  By converting to another religion, you certainly
do change your cultural identity, and lose that part of you which was
Jewish.

	No, there is a serious cultural and religios difference
between renouncing the jewish god and accepting a new one.  "Thou
shall have no other gods before me."  Conversion is a violation of
this, atheism you might be able to wiggle around with.
