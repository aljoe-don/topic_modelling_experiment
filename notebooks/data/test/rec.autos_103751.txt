DON'T BUY IT!  All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches
later on.  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably
know BMW's are not cheap to fix either.  The owner sounds like a shady
character just trying to take advantage of someone. Sure $ 3000 sounds good
but you should calculate how much the repairs will be. It sounds like you
would have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more.
Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned. Who knows how many
miles are on it and how it was driven.  Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but
you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear. For all you know it
could have 200,000 miles on it.  The thing you have to remember is that this
isn't the last 528i around either. Just wait and keep shopping. For around $
5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better, needs less repair, and has
legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering. Take it from a guy who
has been taken a couple of times. Good luck.
