said re. Dan Schaertel's article [if I followed the quoting right]:

I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we
take the appellation `Rabbi' seriously then Jesus had a full
grasp of contemporary `scripture'
Following from this, he would have been in a wonderful
position to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:
If the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not
been accessible then it probably would be a different
matter.
