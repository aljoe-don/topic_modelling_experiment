Yup, it's not all that difficult to do.
The Panasonic cartridges aren't bad, but they aren't spectacular.
Don't mount it on the side.  Call up Crown, the company that has the
patent on the PZM, and ask them for information on construction and
use of the things.  You may have to determine the correct spacing
emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the
design of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of
the electret element to increase the high frequency response, and you
are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance.
Crown has a nice book on the subject, though it's unfortunately rather
short on mathematics.  There's a JAES article from many years back, too.
Still, for your application, you'll be a lot better off buying the cheap
Radio Shack models and using Phil Rastoczny's modifications to get a
clean balanced output.  Phil's mods seem to get reposted here on a regular
basis.
