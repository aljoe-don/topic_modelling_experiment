Yes -- great chapter.  Elizabeth Friedman (sp?) comes shining through.
However, the chapter also notes that these rum runners invented their own
crypto -- hired ex-military folks, in fact.  (How's that for a revolving
door?)
Now, given that today's rum runners (coke runners, actually) have even more
money than yesterday's, it's reasonable to expect them to have even better
cryptography.  I doubt they have a chip foundry of their own yet, but ....
So, my question of the FBI/NIST/NSA is: "How are you going to make the rum
runners use the Clipper Chip?"
		rights has evaporated.  How do you justify our loss of rights
		if you can't use the drug dealers and terrorists?
