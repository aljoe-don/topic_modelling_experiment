How about letting in the press?
How about letting Koresh out to talk to the press?
Maybe if he had been allowed to talk with the press/TV for a couple of
days he would have surrendered peacefully.
How about letting the relatives of Koresh`s followers talk?
Seems to me when you isolate someone, try to send them crazy by playing
loudspeakers through the night of Tibetan chants, etc., you don`t have
much to stand on when they behave as if they are crazy.  (I`m not too
sure of their sanity to start with.)
I am VERY suspicious when the government controls all communication,
and sends the press 2 miles away. 
I have a gut feeling that no-knock warrant, which is sealed, would not
stand up to scrutiny.
I don`t think no-knock warrants are what the constitution writers had
in mind when they gave us rights against improper search and seizure.
I don`t think an all-powerful central, high-taxing government was
what the constitution writers had in mind when it delagated rights
to the citizens and states and restricted central government.
