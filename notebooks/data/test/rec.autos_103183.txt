this is an interesting point.  some people are not really buying the coverage,
they are buying 'peace of mind', marketing folks love selling that.  i suggest
that people *choose* to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than
buying that 'peace of mind'.
you'd be surprised how much the little knick-knack stuff can cost?  what if 
your a/c goes out?  steering rack??  don't get me wrong...i'm against all
extended warranties...they are a ripoff.
extra 3 yrs?  you realize the first 3yr/36k is free warranty that comes with 
the car.
