12) How to order standards documents.
The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also
ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,
mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the
complete name and number.
Some useful numbers to know:
CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical
Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985. ...
You might also want to look at gplot from the folks at the Pittsburgh
Supercomputer Center.  Fish around at calpe.psc.edu.  It is pretty
nifty.
