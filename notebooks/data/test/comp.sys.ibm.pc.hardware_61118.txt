I have the 1 meg card with the Crystal Scan 15 inch also.  I see very
faint shadows on the left side of the screen only in 1024 x 768 mode,
but not enough to really bother me.  The characters on the screen
are clear until I turn on the Crystal Fonts, then they become blurry.
I have a friend who has 2 meg on the video card who has the same shadows,
but says the Crystal Fonts are, well, crystal clear.
We are both using build 59 of the mach32 drivers. Neither of us has a monitor
extension cable.  I tried the build55 driver and found no difference.
