Bo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James, Peter, and Jude_ points
out that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing
the elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general.  Hence, those
who were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension,
God); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Quoting Reike:
	"Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament,
	refer to idolatry, while "flesh" (as in I Pet 1:24) 
	denotes human society and its violent attempts at self-
	exaltation.  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders
	of apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to
	their followers." [p. 199]
There is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring
to actual sexual lust for "alien flesh".  Nor is it inherently necessary
to understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular
reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin
of homosexuality.  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, and
not merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 "This was the guilt of your sister
bit did not aid the poor and needy.  They were haughty, and did abominable
things before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.
For the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent's
suggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexuality
is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly.  There 
are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the
Sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se.
