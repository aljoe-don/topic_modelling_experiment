A priest I know gave me an interesting explanation.  He said that the
words of Mary point not to doubt or troubled thoughts, but rather to
complete humbleness.  Those who are humble and do not revel in
themselves frequently are confused when given high praise about
themselves, as Mary would rightly be.
