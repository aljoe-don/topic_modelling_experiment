Lori, the regular Penguins poster here on rec.sport.hockey, indicated to me
via e-mail that on the nights that Pirates baseball and Penguins playoff 
games coincide, the Pens will be covered on WDVE FM (102.5).

This is WJR in Detroit and it's 760 AM. However, as I neglected to mention in
my earlier response to this thread,  on the nights when the Tigers baseball
games coincide with the Wings' playoff games, the Wings will be carried on
WLLZ FM (98.7).
