me more than anything was not that George was speaking up agai and complaining
to the media instead of to the proper people, it was that the idiot reporter
provided George with an outlet and an opportunity to create trouble.  This is a
supreme example of how the media can truly control situations.  The local beat
reporters should know better and should stop trying to one-up each other with
quotes from the Boss.  If they just ignored him, he'd really simply go away,
and problems would be avoided.  What that reporter did was potentially to open
up the floodgates again--asshole.
