Implying, no so tacitly, that homosexual men are more promiscuous than
heterosexual men.  Interesting, especially in the wake of a news report
last week about a group of high school seniors (heterosexual, I might
add) who boasted monthly conquests of up to *67* girls *each*.  It
seems that promiscuity is not limited to homosexuals.
This is a sad fact of life: no matter what you look for -- whether it 
be homosexual promiscuity, racial discrimination, or sexual harassment
-- you *will* find it.  Whether or not it actually exists where you're
looking.
