I have a feeling that you are not "the enemy".  There are without a doubt 
dickhead cops.  But there are at least as many dickhead bikers, even here 
(you know who you are :-).  I will certainly give you the same benefit of 
the doubt as any other biker here.  Welcome.
I think I can speak for the entire DoD in this.
