For what it's worth...
I haven't been able to open an ftp session with that machine.
Operating under the assumption that the address was wrong, I tried using
nslookup and nicname/whois...
[nnsc.nsf.net]
Host or domain name            Internet address

 ncsl                           server = mail-gw.ncsl.nist.gov         
 mail-gw.ncsl                   129.6.48.199
 ncsl                           server = dove.nist.gov                 
 ncsl                           server = ecf.ncsl.nist.gov             
 ecf.ncsl                       129.6.48.2
 ncsl                           server = enh.nist.gov                  
 ncsl                           server = SUNMGR.NCSL.NIST.GOV          
 SUNMGR.NCSL                    129.6.48.12

That's all I could find about the ncsl domain...oh, and I tried an MX lookup
on the machine in question, which failed.  Nicname/whois domain lookups at
both registries failed, too. 
So I thought, "hey, I'm just not using the tools right" and tried calling
the BBS number -- no answer.
I'm probably doing something wrong...or, perhaps, the machine has been put
behind a firewall.  But it does look like csrc.ncsl.nist.gov has become an
un-machine.  If someone would try ftp'ing to it, or knows what's up, I'd
really appreciate the info.
