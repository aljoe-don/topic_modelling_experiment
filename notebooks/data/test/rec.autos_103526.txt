I is a strong deterent to the teens that are executed.  They won't do that
again!  This policy cuts way down on repeat offenders.
Please do not flame me - I don't agree with capital punishment for teen's.
They are also unsupervised.  With proper supervision, they would not be
throwing rocks.  If parents cannot provide the minimal supervision needed
to stop this activity, they should not be allowed to have children :-)
Notice the smiley ;-)
