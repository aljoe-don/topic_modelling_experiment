There is a difference between supporting Claytons opinions and supporting
his right to speak.  I want you to know that you cannot educate and/or
elevate ones understanding by calling him names.  Clayton has an opinion
which in his mind is as valid as any opinion anyone else on the net has.
If you were to walk up to black person to talk about blacks in the inner
city and began the conversation with "Those niggers in th.......".  You
would lose the attention of that black person by the time you spoke your
second word.  All name calling and derisive remarks do is turn off the
audience you are trying to address.  Clayton is guilty of that and as
such has distracted attention away from his message to bits and pieces
of his conversation.  I don't understand why people want to repeat his
mistakes!
