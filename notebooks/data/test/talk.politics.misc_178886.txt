You mean, in the 1940s, men and women were much more open about
their homosexuality than today?  Want to try that one again?
You mean, ignore study after study, so that we can continue to 
accept a study (Kinsey's) that is obviously wrong?  
Based on what, besides your own warm fuzzy feelings?
Alcoholics share that feeling, until they hit bottom.
Unless, of course, the problem is that homosexuality is a form
of mental disorder, caused by childhood sexual abuse, as a number of
recent works suggest.
If homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their
morality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children
alone, I wouldn't care in the least what they did in private.  But
until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of 
government is to tell peaceful people how to live, I have no choice
but to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an "alternative
lifestyle," but a sickness.
Good signature!
