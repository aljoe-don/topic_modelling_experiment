Pakistan definitely comes in ambit of the economic colonialism.
The utility rates (electricity, water and gas) are set by IMF and
World Bank. Governments come and go at whims and fancy of the
State Department. I have yet to see a Pakistani govt. survive that
doesnot have the support of the State Department.
