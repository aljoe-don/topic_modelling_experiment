Well, apparently once you get past about 6 inches, all the luggage shifts back in the panniers, the passenger slides back, and the dog ends up hanging onto the top rack,
and they go all the way over until it's flat on it's ass, with the front wheel
straight up in the sky.  Impressive, but hard on the tail lights. :)
