Have you ever been violently sick repeatedly?  I have, and it was difficult to 
drag myself back to my bed, much less move through a building full of smoke and
debris, especially when most likely already disoriented from lack of sleep and
constant psychological abuse...  Throw in the fact that the 'safety' outside
consists of people who have shot at me and thrown grenades at me, and are
currently knocking my house down with tanks, I could understand if the BD's
were inclined to stay put in the center of the building...
