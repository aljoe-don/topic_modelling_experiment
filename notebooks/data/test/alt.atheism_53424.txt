I wouldn't punish him with eternal torture if he didn't love me. But then
I;m a decent chap. It seems your god isn't.
I've looked, and he wasn't. Another promise broken.
Lying bastard! How  do you know what effort I have and have not given? 
Can anyone eaplain what he's just said here?
Peter
Don't forget to sing:
            They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
                Some say it's better, but I say it ain't
        I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
                     The sinners are much more fun
                         Only the good die young!
