That's your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful
as the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore
belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this
is *any* belief, not belief in Gods)
If you believe that, you're incredibly naive.
No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common
with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn't implied by
what you say before, because you're trying to sneak in "innate features
of [all] theism".  The word you're groping for is "some".
No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed
to the case you are trying to make?
I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That's because it's an irrational
and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us 
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either
side of church walls.
O.K., it's oval.  It's still begging the question, however.  And though
that certainly is allowed, it's not rational.  And you claiming to be
rational and all.
At the risk of repeating myself, and hearing "we had that before" [we
didn't hear a _refutation_ before, so we're back.   Deal with it] :
you can't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  Someone
who thinks reason is crap won't buy it, you see.
Anybody else think Godel was silly?
That at some point, people always wind up saying "this datum is reliable" 
for no particular reason at all.  Example: "I am not dreaming".
IMO, any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  That does
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of
intelligence.  Some atheists are also scientists, for example.
Peculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  Now show that a belief
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren't my 
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they 
don't believe in it.  Maybe it's the conjunction of "B asserts B" and
"jail/kill dissenters" that is important, and the belief in gods is
entirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no
axe to grind here.
