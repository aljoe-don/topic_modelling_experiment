Kent, with regards to the information contained in the Bible (which
is the original context of this thread), Brian Kendig is inside a huge
wall.  Brian *IS* inside.  The Bible and the information contained therein
are outside the wall.   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the
absurd things he says.  For example, "If I get through into the firey
pit, I will cease to exist."  The Bible doesn't say that.  He hasn't
a clue even to what Jesus said about hell.  That is but one example.
Now in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a different
matter.  And to you and to Brian, relativity does play a big role.
What we perceive to be true, depends on our vantage point.  Since I
have read the Bible, and Brian Kendig shows that he hasn't, he has 
a narrower perspective than mine  (at least in the respect
of knowledge of the Bible).   I am proposing to Brian, "Brian, come up here
and take a look from this vantage point."   But Brian replies, "I rather
not thank you.  I am content where I am.  Besides, the vista from up
there stinks."   And in the meanwhile, Brian ignores the facts that
he has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the same
plateau where Brian now stands.
