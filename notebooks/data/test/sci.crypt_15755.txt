It's not a question just of who is holding the phone.  It's a question of
what circuit to wiretap in the first place.  If two drug dealers are both
using stolen cellular phones, the FBI doesn't know which lines to tap
-- unless of course they're tapping *all* phones (maybe *all* cellular
phones).  If they haven't tapped the connection (ie., at least one end of
the connection) then they don't know what key to request.
