I would prefer a picture with you in it.  Since most motorcycles don't post,
and are rather similar looking (i.e all R100S's are more alike than they are
different), it is the people that are ultimately more interesting.
From archive_policy.txt:
BTW, I have Charlie Smith's pictures available.
Interestingly, I've been to Stanley, ID by motorcycle.  Nice little town,
nice road getting there.
