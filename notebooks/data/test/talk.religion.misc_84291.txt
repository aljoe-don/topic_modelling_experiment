I'm presently searching for enlightenment, answers to the unanswerable,
a certain amount of direction without actually going anywhere.
Could Kibology be it?  I don't know enough about Kibology and wish that
someone can help me.
After I've spread my ninth tube of anchovy paste on my living room
wall to creat my own form of art I need some higher authority to 
turn towards to give my life some meaning.  Maybe Kibology is the
answer.  It's either that or I go out to the store and buy up another
case of anchovy paste.
