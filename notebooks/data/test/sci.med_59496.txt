There's always the old switcheroo.
My brother works at a dialysis clinic.  They were interviewing 
candidates for a technician job (mainly electronics tech), and a
urine screen was part of the interview.  The bathroom was across
the hall from a lab.  One candidate managed to switch his urine
sample with one he grabbed from the lab.  (No one was in it at
the time.)
Most inner-city dialysis patients have quite a few medical problems,
so it was immediately obvious what had happened.  My brother 
fleetingly considered telling the candidate, "I'm sorry but you
are very ill and need medical attention immediately."  They offered
him another *well-monitored* chance and he declined.
