Oh, really?  
Here's what you posted earlier in another thread.  Before you thrash
others for making simple mistakes or flaunt your wonderful "vi skill",
think about how you make them feel as well as how you look (you spelled
it right). ;-}
For years you have assaulted others with offensive language, etc.  From
the content of many of your posts, you appear to have a lot of useful
information to share with people, but it gets overshadowed when you come
across as an abusive smart-ass.
