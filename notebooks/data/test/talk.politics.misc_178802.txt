I'm no defender of the AEC, but it is worth noting that it is unfair to tar
that organization with the decidedly minority scientific views of its
former chairperson and one term Washington governor, Dr. Dixie Lee Ray.
Dr. Ray's political agenda is well-known and documented.  Likewise, her
lack of objectivity in analysing scientific data is well-known.
