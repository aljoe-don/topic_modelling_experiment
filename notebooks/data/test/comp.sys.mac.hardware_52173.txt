        Thank you very much. These computers behave exactly like what 
you're describing. Now, my question. I am running on the lowest of all 
budgets, public education. How can I analyze this? All I need is some 
sort of packet counter. Do any exist, and where are they?
        Thanks again,
                                -- Andrew Geweke
