Don't give up so soon.  A lot of Burgh fans didn't give up at 3-1 last year.
You gotta believe!  (Hard as that may seem)  With the Caps with the #1 power
play in the playoffs and #1 penalty killing (according to Mike Lange) all
the Caps have to do is make sure it doesn't go OT...as that was Boston's and
Chicago's demise.  OT can be a curse.
