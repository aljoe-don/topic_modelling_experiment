	We bought one from Relax technologies.  BIG mistake.  The drive
had some jumpers set incorrectly so it didn't work at first, and the
software they shipped with it was incompatable with the drive (it was the
new compression model), and worst of all, when I opened the drive up to
fiddle with the jumpers, I found the inside of the case COVERED WITH METAL
FILINGS!!! Sorry to shout.  Apparently when they drilled the mounting holes
in the case they forgot to clean it before putting the drive in.  This was
a HP drive, by the way, and is now working fine (knock on wood), no thanks
to Relax technologies.
Hey, your mileage may vary, but let me suggest that you NOT buy from Relax
Technologies, even though their prices are usually about the lowest.
