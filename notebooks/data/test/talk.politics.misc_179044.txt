In a previous article, mwilson@ncratl.AtlantaGA.NCR.COM (Mark Wilson) says:

         The BATF warrant was unsealed yesterday.
         The entire operation was illegal from day ONE.
       No authority for a "no-knock" raid.
       No authority to use the Texas helicopters.
       No authority to search for a "drug lab".  More ATF lies.
       Clinton and Reno are lying fucks.
