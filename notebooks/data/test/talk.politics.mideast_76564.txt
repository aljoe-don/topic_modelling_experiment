  Let's keep some perspective here.
  IMHO, the Josh's policy of forwarding the garbage in question,
  without comment, to the relevant sysadmin strikes a good
  balance.  The stuff was, after all, PUBLISHED on a public
  forum -- from that very site, yet.  Hardly a matter of
  confidentiality or copyright.  If the local administration
  wants to do something about it, they have that right.  If
  not, nobody's twisting their arms.
