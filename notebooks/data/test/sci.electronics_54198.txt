Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental
psychologists at Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and
memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond
refresh rates common.
So your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were
probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either.

Engineering is a _lot_ like art:  Some circuits are like lyric poems, some
are like army manuals, and some are like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy..
