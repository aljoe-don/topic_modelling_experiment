I think you are, small, feeble minded, bunghole.
Yeah, it was one stupid little act.
When are people like you gonna get it through they're thick
excuses for a skull to their pea-sized piece of shit they
call a brain that it _was_ _once_?
why don't you go back under the rock that the navy has provided
for you and your homophobic racist sexist asshole "friends" that
who give you daily rim jobs and place your opinion where it belongs,
UP YOUR ASS!?
Or, alternatively, blow me, you closeted wannabe.
