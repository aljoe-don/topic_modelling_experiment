Yes, but the extra encryption could be applied *before* the message
is encrypted by the Clipper, so that the wrapper would be fine, the
phone's serial number and the session key would be in the law-enforcement
field, etc., but the message wouldn't be readable even if the particular
Clipper's key were obtained from the escrow agents.  In fact, it shouldn't
even be possible to detect that a message has been double-encrypted without
a court order, right?
