I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily
pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If
that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify
or refute this?
