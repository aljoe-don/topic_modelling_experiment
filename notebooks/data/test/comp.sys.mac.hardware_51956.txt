That seems about right.  I have a Mac IIsi 5/130 with 64k cache card running
System 7.1.  My roommate has a 486sx/25 5/200+ running Windows 3.1 and from
what I've seen, my IIsi is faster in some operations.  In others, they are
comparable...But keep in mind I'm strictly speaking of operations on the
desktop level of Windows 3.1 and System 7.1, not actual computational speed
in other programs...
