	Run your bike on the lowest octane that it will run smoothly on. 
Higher octane fuel is not "better" than lower octane gas. Pick up the last 
American Roadracing magazine. There's a short article in there about 
octane and the misconceptions many people make about the subject. Look at
your owners manual. I believe it states 87 is just fine.
