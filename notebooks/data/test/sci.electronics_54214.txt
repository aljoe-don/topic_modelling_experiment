It would take a lot more than that. It sounds like the radio equipment is
actually not shut completely off - but just goes to a standby situation.
I suspect that the stories are just that, stories.  The voltage can only
be sucked down so far instantaneously. When you try to jumpstart someones 
car, when your vehicle is at idle, does your car stall? No, the other car
just does not crank well.  Now, the engine might stall because the idle
was too low to start with. When the extra current is drawn, the idle speed
will drop - as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the
increased amperage requirement.
A transmitter is not going to be affecting house power. If surges are
occurring there, it is due to another cause - not a transmitter.
It is probably not that much of a problem. Often - toroid coils on the
power leads will solve that part of the interference problem. It will
not solve internal equipment deficiencies.
It is probably not the transmitter that is at fault. If the person is an
amateur, then he/she will probably be willing to help - if you explain
that the person is causing interference.
