I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now.
SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives
(ESDI,RLL,IDE,etc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers
to get it to work with odd environments.
For information purposes, I had:
ST-01 Card + ST296N drive and a MAXTOR 212a drive with generic IDE
controller running together. I have also had the same SCSI setup work
in combination with a RLL drive, the ST251-1 drive.
