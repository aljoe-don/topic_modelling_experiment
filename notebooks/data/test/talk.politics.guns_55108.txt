I've seen lots of notes like these in various newspaper classified sections.  But then
under Hunting or Sporting Goods or Outdoor or Collector's classifications, you
see things like, Colt AR15 .223 hunting rifle,  or Galil .223 sporting arm...
stuff like that.  The newspaper gets to make its editorial statement, plus they
get the revenue anyway...
