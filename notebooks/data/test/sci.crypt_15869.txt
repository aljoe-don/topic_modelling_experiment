Not when your talking about cryptography.
Think again.  You won't see me using apple's new signature from the
finder feature.
This analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two
squirts about credibility.
In addition, Apple's proclaimed purpose in releasing the Macintosh wasn't
survellience.
Quite the opposite:
"On January 24, Apple will introduce.... Macintosh, and you'll see why
1984 won't be, like '1984'"
So don't give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to
put mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more.
One of the reasons we should be all the more suspicious.  When was the
last time the president wasted his time to comfort americans?
Just another reason to look closely at exactally what's going on.
