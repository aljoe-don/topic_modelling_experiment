You are absolutely right. After reading it over again, I realized that I
misunderstood what he said. My apologies. As for the question about
slavery, I have to disagree. Slavery in those times was the same as slavery
in the US. Some may have been indentured servants, but not all. I would also
expect Paul to do a little more than just HINT about a particular slave.
