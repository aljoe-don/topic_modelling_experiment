The difference is that straight members are given the choice of
abstaining or not, and celibacy is recognized as a gift, given only
to some.  Gays are told that, as a condition of acceptance, they
_must_ be celibate.  I don't believe that God gives me a forced choice
between having a relationship with God and expressing my heterosexuality
(within the context of a faithful relationship).  Nor do I believe
that God gives that forced choice to gays.  Sex or Christianity is a
false dichotomy.
For my part, gay churches remind me of blacks starting their own churches
either because they were not allowed at all in the white churches, or, at
best, only with special restrictions that did not apply to white members.
