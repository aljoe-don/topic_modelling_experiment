Not always true. In fact, in the case of Doug Gilmour, he actually praises them.
Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion. Canadian kids
that do them are "tough, just like a real Canadian". 
Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head. Doug
Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming. 
Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter.
I used to like Don Cherry. I thought he was great. But I'm starting to see
his true colors (redneck) and the more I see of them, the more I think he's
just an asshole.
