Determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your
config.sys  If you are using W4WW you might want to go a couple of drives higher
to give you some shared drive space.  Reboot and Novell will set its first
drive one above the lastdrive in config.sys.  You might have to remap some
of your Novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives.  Make
sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto Novell is set
to the correct drive (one above the lastdrive setting in the config.sys file).
