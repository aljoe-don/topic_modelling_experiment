Here in the middle of Connecticut there are plenty of Bruin Fans, many who have
let me know in no uncertain terms that the Rangers choked down the stretch.  I
think the Bruins are doing the same exact thing the Rangers did, they're
playing too tight!!  Who's responsibility is it to check Mogilny?  He has
gotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many rebounds
which are not being cleared by the B's defense.  It's too bad the B's might not
get the opportunity to play Pittsburgh again.  I would really enjoy seeing
Ulfie get beat up by Neely.  We all hate Ulfie, but would love him on are
team!!
