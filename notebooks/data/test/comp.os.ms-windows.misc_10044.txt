You CAN print to a file from an HP (or any other printer).  Just go into
the Printers section of your Control Panel.  Select the printer you want
to re-direct to a file, and click on Connect.  Then choose :FILE as the
port to connect the printer to.
When you print from any application to that printer, Windows will prompt
you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the
printout.
It's pretty easy.
Good luck!
