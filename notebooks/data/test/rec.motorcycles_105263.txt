In a previous article, phj@remus.rutgers.edu (P. Ju) says:
Sure don't know what bike was being worked on but it sure wasn't a
Virago.  I've owned both the 750 and 1100 and you can do the filter
change in about 5 mins and nothing has to be removed.  Obviously the
"new" bike was modified as the stock machine is simple to work on.
  Watching for imitators!!
